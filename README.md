# USA Hockey Registration form
This is a real project for the client USA Hockey, which required a redesign of their registration form to make it more modern, user-friendly, and accessible from mobile devices, as the majority of users accessed it via mobile.

Additionally, many users were older and needed larger font sizes and better color contrast for improved readability.

Here, I share the templates I delivered the dev team to implement, they are fully responsive from desktop to mobile.
